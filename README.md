# ImgDB
Since October 2013, the research group "Revolts as Communicative Events" and their partners in France have been setting up an interactive image database to collect, categorise and interpret graphics, paintings and photographs related to conflict and violence. "ImgDB" was previously hosted on the University of Konstanz (Germany) website.
